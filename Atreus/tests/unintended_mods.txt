This test verifies no unintended modifers are activated
when using home row mods on the QWERTY layout.

Examples of unintended modifers while typing quickly with
home row mods in QWERTY layout:

1. typing `less` and activating modifier [Opt] instead of
   `l`, resulting in Opt+L instead of `le`.

2. typing `could` and activating modifier [Opt] instead of
   `l`, resulting in Opt+D instead of `ld`.

3. typing `add ` and activating modifier [Cmd] instead of
   `d`, resulting in Cmd+space instead of `d `.

Type the following as quickly as possible and repeat each
line 3-5 times. Expect no unintended modifiers.

could could could  add less add less again
add less add less add less less less again
could could could could again
