# Keyboards

This repos contains my custom keyboard firmware and layouts for Keyboardio [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope) powered keyboards.

I'll include more details for building these.

The quick gist is to follow the instructions in the Kaleidoscope README, being sure to set `KALEIDOSCOPE_DIR` to where the Kaleidoscope source files are located.
